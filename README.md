# FakeEnum

This is my attempt to implement Ruby's Enumerable module.

## Why

[Gregory Brown][seacreature] released an article on
[Practicing Ruby][practicing] showing how to implement the Enumerable
module. I thought it would be a great idea and also a good exercise to continue 
implementing the other methods that the article didn't cover.
